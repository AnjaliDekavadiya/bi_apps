Example For Larger Job
process costing is a method of costing applied in industries where production is measured in terms of completed jobs. Industries where process costing is generally applied are Printing Press. Automobile Garage, Repair workshops, Ship Building, Foundry and other similar manufacturing units which manufacture to customers� specific requirements.

process costing is a method of costing whereby cost is compiled for a job or work order. The production is against customer�s orders and not for stock. The cost is not related to the unit of production but is a cost for the job, e. g printing of 5000 ledger sheets, repairs of 50 equipment�s, instead of printing one sheet or repair of one equipment.

The elements of cost comprising Prime Cost viz. direct materials, direct labour and direct expenses are charged directly to the jobs concerned, the overhead charged to a job is an apportioned portion of the departmental overhead.
