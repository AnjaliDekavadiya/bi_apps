About
============
In business sometimes products prices should be hidden for many reasons. These items might be free, out of stock or their prices change frequently and need to be verified by phone, email, etc. Call For Price To CRM is a tool with a flexible option, you can effectively manage all the product price status by deciding which are displayed, which must be contacted to know the price. The product that enables a call for the price will hide the price, then add a button call for price. The customer clicks the button to send price requests to the merchant about products and that request is a lead or opportunity for the merchant. From lead/opportunity you can easily create a new quotation of the related products.
